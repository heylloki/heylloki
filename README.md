Hello, I'm Lloki. 
My interests revolve around learning cool new tricks and sharing cool things I stumble across.
Right now I'm trying to get a hold of Python as a beginner programmer and Bubble as a beginner app developer.
Might be counterintuitive but it's where curiosity is currently.
Since I'm at the beginning stages, I'm not looking to collaborate but moreso looking for accountability - so I'm here building outloud.
I can be contacted on multiple platforms, most likely will reply on X fkaTwitter.
